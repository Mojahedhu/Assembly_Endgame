# Assembly Endgame

I recreated the **Assembly Endgame** React app as part of my Full Stack Developer journey, applying key React concepts such as:  
## ⚙ The applied React key concept 🚀
- 🎨 **Styling**  
- ⚛️ **JSX & Custom Components**  
- 🔗 **Props**  
- 🔄 **State Management (`useState` & `useEffect`)**  
- 🎭 **Conditional Rendering**  
- 📝 **Forms in React**  

This project is based on the **[Scrimba Learn React](https://github.com/scrimba/learn-react)** course by **Bob Ziroll**. My goal was to solidify my understanding of React fundamentals while enhancing my problem-solving skills.
